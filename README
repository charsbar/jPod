jPod - Japanese pod management toolset

DESCRIPTION

This was originally a tool I used while translating Moose::Manual
for the sake of the Japan Perl Association in 2009.

See http://perldoc.tcool.org/ for web interface.

HOW TO USE

You usually don't need to install this application with
"make install". Just put into somewhere under your home
directory, and run Makefile.PL to confirm you have dependent
modules (run cpanm if you don't have any), then run jpod
script to learn commands.
